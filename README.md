Human tumors are complex, spanning diverse subpopulations of cancer stem cells that together determine the response to therapies. A priori identifying drug resistant cells can uncover the tumors’ vulnerabilities, will better cancer treatments. Intratumoral heterogeneity of preexisting mutations are a main reason for clinical relapse in drug resistance. Knowledge of these, typically rare mutations is vital for accurate cancer diagnosis and pharmacology. When the sensitive mutants are decimated, cells harboring these rare mutations proliferate. Equally important, is the early identification of metastasizing cells. Metastasis is clinically vastly significant, as diffuse metastases are generally the cause of cancer mortality. While the literature abounds with searches for mutations, including rare, here we tackle innovative aims: discovering pairs of mutations co-occurring in different proteins. This is significant, since they can identify corrupt pathways, which single variants cannot, and serve as metastatic markers. Our comprehensive analysis includes pan-cancer mutation profiles of ~60,000 tumor sequences from the TCGA and AACR GENIE databases and identified 3424 statistically significant co-occurring tumor specific mutations. The pathways have different downstream targets indicating that they may promote specific primary tumors. Especially, we list mutations for 2385 metastatic tumors and provide trees of metastatic breast-cancer markers. This innovative work clarifies the mechanistic basis of intratumor mutational diversity, discovers markers for metastasis in patients’ genomes, and establishes the first tool for identifying and predicting metastasis. Crucially, when the mutations are integrated with their pathways, they can provide an invaluable metastasis-targeting resource, and help in selecting drug combinations.
